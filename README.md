## CYD (Cheap Yellow Display) and Micropython

Welcome to this repository for my September 2024 MicroThisMicroThat article where I discuss rather deeply the Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) better known as the ESP32-2432s028r, an integrated ESP-32 and ili9341 touchscreen display.

I spend the majority of the article discussing the CYD in general along with a few lines about using the board under Micropython.



While I'm still uploading files to this repository, one of the things that you will find here will be my Greg's Weather App.  This uses WiFi connection to the OpenWeatherMap to obtain the current outside conditions for my or your (with a bit of a program change on your part) location as well as connection a DHT22 directly to the CYD.
